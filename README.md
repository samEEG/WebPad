# WebPad
A chrome extension that lets you take notes on webpages

Currently a working process however, should be done soon. Star and watch if you are interested 

What can it currently do: 
	- Highlight, bold and italicize words on a webpage
	- Take notes on a webpage

What it still needs to do: 
	- Need to save notes in the background script so that whenever the popup reloads,
	notes made are not gone. Additionally needs to be specific to url visited

Goals: 
	- You can add notes to the webpage. 
	- Any modifications that are made on pages should be saved when site is revisted.
